/**Sometimes, directory or file names have numbers in the middle, and there may be more than one number, for example, sec3_14.txt or sec10_1.txt. 
Provide a comparison operator that can compare such strings in a way that makes sense to humans. 
Break each string into strings not containing digits and digit groups. 
Then compare two strings by comparing the first non-digit groups as strings, the first digit groups as integers, and so on. **/
